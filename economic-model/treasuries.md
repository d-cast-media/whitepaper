# Treasuries

### Multi-signature wallet (Safe) collecting protocol fees&#x20;

* ENS : dsponsor.eth (0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf)
* Deployed on [Ethereum](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf), [Gnosis](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf), [Polygon PoS](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=matic:0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf), [Arbitrum](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf), [Goerli](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gor:0x5b15Cbb40Ef056F74130F0e6A1e6FD183b14Cdaf)
* Currently configured for single confirmation (1/1), steps are being taken to move to a system requiring 3 confirmations from 8 administrators. This will increase the resilience of the protocol.

### Reserve treasury

The establishment of a dedicated treasury for the d>sponsor project is planned. This treasury will hold the reserve of DCAST tokens and serve as a crucial financial pillar. Its purpose is to support the protocol's initiatives and meet future operational needs.
