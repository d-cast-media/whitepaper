# Commission Distribution

{% hint style="warning" %}
The commission mechanism outlined is subject to review and has not yet been finalized.
{% endhint %}

At the beginning of each month, DCAST tokens are distributed based on the revenue generated from the sale of NFTs associated with visibility spaces during the previous month. This process compensates both the buyer (sponsor) and seller (media/creator), as well as any intermediary (business referrer).

### Calculation Criteria

DCAST token distribution will be calculated based on sales transactions made in USDC, MATIC, WETH and WBTC. Payments in other cryptocurrencies are only included if they are later whitelisted by governance decision. This selective approach is intended to prevent any artificial manipulation of the reward distribution and to encourage the contribution of liquid assets with proven value to the Treasury.

Contributions are calculated in US dollars using the exchange rate at the time of the monthly reward distribution, which occurs on the first day of each month.

Every dollar from the sale of an NFT is split equally: 50 cents to the buyer and 50 cents to the seller. The referral model proposes a three-way split: one-third for the buyer, one-third for the seller, and one-third for the referrer.&#x20;

Each participant's total revenue share is calculated based on the previous month's total activity, and DCAST tokens are then distributed proportionally to that share based on the month's total revenue.

### Distribution Examples

SponsorA purchases an NFT from SmallCreator for 10 WETH, generating 0.4 WETH for the Treasury (4% fee), which is equivalent to $1,000. The total revenue collected by the Treasury in the previous month was $20,000. Therefore, this transaction represents 5% of the previous month's total revenue. With no halving to date, the allotment is 1 million DCAST tokens. SponsorA and SmallCreator then split 50,000 $DCAST tokens, receiving 25,000 each.

In the same month, SponsorB purchases an NFT from BigMedia through an affiliate link from Agency3 for 50,000 USDC, generating 2,000 USDC for the treasury. This transaction accounts for 10% of the revenue at the rate of 1 USDC = $1. SponsorB, BigMedia and Agency3 then share 100,000 DCAST, receiving 33,333.33 DCAST each.

### Variation in reward amount

It is important to note that the number of DCAST tokens awarded for the same amount of revenue may vary from month to month depending on the total volume of validated transactions during that period.
