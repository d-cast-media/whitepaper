# Governance

{% hint style="warning" %}
The governance elements described in this section are presented as a proposal and are subject to ongoing adjustment as the project evolves.
{% endhint %}

Governance in d>sponsor plays a crucial role in making strategic decisions and allocating protocol resources. Active participants in the ecosystem are encouraged to voice their opinions on key issues that guide development and fund management.

### Voting Power

Ownership of veDCAST and veDCASTLP tokens entitles the holder to vote on governance decisions. The voting weight varies by token:&#x20;

* Votes from veDCAST token holders represent 28.5% of the final result
* Votes from veDCASTLP token holders represent 71.5% of the final result

#### Example&#x20;

If, on the veDCAST side :&#x20;

* 40% of votes support proposal A
* 60% of votes support proposal B

And on the veDCASTLP side:

* 55% of votes support proposal A
* 45% of votes support proposal B

Le r√©sultat donne :&#x20;

* 0.4 \* 0.285 + 0.55 \* 0.715 = 50.725% for proposal A
* 0.6 \* 0.285 + 0.45 \* 0.715 = 49.275% for proposal B

### Governance functions

* _**Community rewards**_: Each month, veDCAST and veDCASTLP token holders participate in deciding the distribution of community rewards to recognize significant contributions to the ecosystem.
* _**Treasury spending**_: Governance decides on the use of [15% of the monthly treasury income](rewards.md). These funds can be invested in DeFi, support other projects, or be used for charitable purposes.
* _**DCAST token reward mechanism**_: Governance has the power to change the list of cryptocurrencies recognized in the [calculation of treasury revenue](../tokenomics/commission-distribution.md).
* _**Fee Setting**_ : An essential aspect of governance is the ability to influence the [protocol's fee](../../fees-collected.md) structure, including the percentages taken during NFT mints and royalties on secondary transactions.

### Governance security

Given the significant impact of decisions on the integrity of the protocol, governance processes are thoroughly analyzed to prevent any attempts at manipulation or attack. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust governance framework that ensures ecosystem protection while promoting democratic and informed participation.
