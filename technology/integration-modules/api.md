# API

The d>sponsor APIs are a central element of the protocol, enabling integration with external systems while minimizing the technical complexity associated with blockchain technologies.

### GraphQL API

Developed using [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/), this API leverages events emitted by the protocol's smart contracts to provide a rich and customizable interface. Using GraphQL, developers can extract precise and customized data, simplifying the extraction and manipulation of necessary on-chain information.

### REST API

The d>sponsor REST API focuses on the delivery of advertising assets and provides a direct way to integrate sponsored content into applications, e.g. via _iframes_.
