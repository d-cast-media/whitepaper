# SDK

The d>sponsor SDKs are designed to provide an even higher level of abstraction than the APIs. An SDK encapsulates API calls within language-specific functions (such as JavaScript, Python, etc.), making integration easier for developers and accelerating the development of custom applications that interact with the d>sponsor protocol.
