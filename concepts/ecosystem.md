{% endtabs %}

### Business Referrers

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Developers" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Individuals" %}
Referrers mentioned during an NFT purchase are rewarded, promoting a system that values contributions beyond financial support.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_The protocol could benefit from other types of sponsors, such as influencers, brand ambassadors in the crypto sector, web3 marketing consultants, or specialized web3 affiliate platforms. This diversification would strengthen the protocol's dynamics and broaden its scope of action._

### Advertising Agencies

The potential for creating companies that bridge the gap between web3 and traditional advertising is significant. d>sponsor is leading the way for a new generation of agencies offering consultancy, audience analysis, and ad creation services. As with programmatic advertising, agencies can now act as intermediaries between advertisers and d>sponsor.

#### Advertising Networks 3.0

The emergence of structures that invest in advertising spaces through d>sponsor to monetize them through traditional methods is conceivable.

#### Performance Measurement

Sponsors prioritize measuring investment profitability for their campaign success. Currently, advertisers rely on audience data from advertising networks or specialized agencies, but this data lacks transparency and is centralized.

The d>sponsor protocol does not measure audience or campaign performance. The media initially sets the prices for the spaces, which are then adjusted by the secondary market. As a result, the cost-to-visibility ratio and performance are subjectively determined by the trading activity of NFTs associated with the advertising spaces.

Sponsors are responsible for developing their own methods to assess ROI/ROAS. For instance, a CTA link (like in the case of sponsorship through a clickable logo) could include [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM\_parameters) or be analyzed using tools such as [Linkly](https://linklyhq.com/). Specialized agencies might provide tailored support to sponsors, offering custom solutions for performance measurement.

### Long-Term Vision: d>cast, the First Web3 Media Network

d>sponsor is a step towards creating d>cast, the reference DAO for decentralized media. This vision encompasses all web3-oriented media activities: from publishing and community engagement to monetization and audience measurement, all managed through the $DCAST token.
