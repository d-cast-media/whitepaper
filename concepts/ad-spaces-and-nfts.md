# Ad Spaces & NFTs

### "Tokenizing" Audience Exposure

d>sponsor revolutionizes media and content creator funding by allowing sponsors to purchase advertising spaces temporarily or permanently.

The value of these ad spaces is market-driven, based on the target audience. Using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for this exposure offers significant advantages:

* **Eliminating intermediaries:** Blockchain technology facilitates direct transactions between creators and sponsors, reducing costs and complications from middlemen.
* **Ownership proof:** When a sponsor purchases an NFT for an ad space, they receive an irrefutable digital certificate granting exclusive rights to that space.
* **Easy implementation and interoperability:** The ERC721 NFT standard simplifies development and promotes collaboration and integration with other decentralized applications.
* **Financial flexibility:** Transactions can be made in various cryptocurrencies, and sponsors can resell or lease their NFT on any compatible marketplace.
* **Authenticity and traceability:** Each NFT is unique, and its usage history (origin, validity of ads) is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring total transparency and authenticity of each slot.

Integrating NFT technology into the media world enables a new era of monetization, allowing media to maintain independence while providing quality and freely accessible information.

### Direct Interactions Between Sponsors and Creators

***

1. **Ad Offer Creation:** Creators detail the ad spaces. Each token represents a unique space. The associated NFT collection can either be pre-existing or created. If the collection is to be created, the creator must specify the number of spaces and their prices.
2. **Exposure Definition:** Creators outline the duration and [nature of the exposure](advertising-solutions.md), such as web banners, newsletter logos, or video pre-rolls, along with sales clauses and terms of use for the NFT, which sponsors agree to upon purchase.
3. **NFT Acquisition:** Sponsors buy an NFT to gain ownership of the associated ad space.
4. **Ad Submission:** Owning the NFT, sponsors propose ads for their space, adhering to the predefined exposure criteria.
5. **Ad Validation:** Creators review and either approve or reject the proposed ads. If a proposal is rejected, the sponsor can submit a new one.&#x20;

These steps are facilitated through [smart contract](../technology/smart-contracts.md) transactions on a blockchain.

#### _Validated Ads Integration_

Creators [integrate approved ads](../technology/integration-modules/) into their platforms (e.g., via iframe) and commit to the agreed-upon exposure. A decentralized penalty mechanism for unmet exposure promises is planned for future implementation.



#### _Ad Modification_&#x20;

Sponsors can propose new ads anytime, following the initial submission and validation process.



_**Ownership Transfer**_

Sponsors can sell their NFTs on secondary markets (e.g., [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)), transferring ad space ownership.\


#### _Purchase Option_&#x20;

A future feature will allow sponsors to make conditional purchase offers contingent on ad approval.

NFTs revolutionize funding in the media and creative industries by offering simplicity, transparency, and financial agility. This enables sponsors to maximize their investments while effectively supporting content creators.
