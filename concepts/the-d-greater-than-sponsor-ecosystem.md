# The d>sponsor Ecosystem

The d>sponsor protocol coordinates various players, including media, advertisers, and business referrers, to align their interests strategically. It is designed for seamless integration into the current advertising and media landscape, emphasizing decentralization, transparency, and composability. It offers an attractive alternative to traditional monetization models.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_It should be noted that as the protocol matures and web3 adoption becomes more widespread, influencers and traditional media are expected to enter._

### Funding Actors in **d>sponsor**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Individuals" %}
d>sponsor presents a more advantageous model than traditional methods such as donations for those wishing to support media. The market is valued at [ $1.4 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1078273/global-crowdfunding-market-size/).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="DAOs" %}
Decentralized organizations can use their on-chain treasury for marketing initiatives. [The estimated total value of cryptoassets held is $15 billion](https://deepdao.io/organizations).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Blockchain Sector Companies" %}
dsponsor provides web3 projects with transparency and simplification in token distribution for influencer campaigns. [A report by MarketsandMarkets predicts that the web3 marketing market will reach $100 billion by 2030](https://coinbound.io/web3-marketing-stats/).&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_As the protocol develops, advertisers from more traditional sectors will become part of the ecosystem._

### Business Referrers

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Developers" %}
The protocol promotes the development of interfaces that are linked to deployed contracts. Developer teams that contribute to the project's success by adding value and generating revenue are rewarded with commissions.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Individuals" %}
Individuals who refer a media or creator and are mentioned as a referrer during an NFT acquisition through d>sponsor will receive rewards for their contribution. This affiliate mechanism is designed to actively value and reward those who support creators in non-financial ways, while also expanding the reach of the protocol.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_The protocol could benefit from other types of sponsors, such as influencers, brand ambassadors in the crypto sector, web3 marketing consultants, or specialized web3 affiliate platforms. This diversification would strengthen the protocol's dynamics and broaden its scope of action._

### Advertising Agencies

The potential for creating companies that bridge the gap between web3 and traditional advertising is significant. d>sponsor is leading the way for a new generation of agencies that offer services such as consultancy, audience analysis, and ad creation. As with programmatic advertising, agencies can now act as intermediaries between advertisers and d>sponsors.

#### Advertising Networks 3.0

The emergence of structures that invest in advertising spaces through d>sponsor to monetize them through traditional methods is conceivable.

#### Performance Measurement

Sponsors prioritize measuring investment profitability for their campaign success. Currently, advertisers rely on audience data from advertising networks or specialized agencies, but this data lacks transparency and is centralized.

The d>sponsor protocol does not measure audience or campaign performance. The media initially sets the prices for the spaces, which are then adjusted by the secondary market. As a result, the cost-to-visibility ratio and performance are subjectively determined by the trading activity of NFTs associated with the advertising spaces.

Sponsors are responsible for developing their own methods to assess ROI/ROAS. For instance, a CTA link (like in the case of sponsorship through a clickable logo) could include [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM\_parameters) or be analyzed using tools such as [Linkly](https://linklyhq.com/). Specialized agencies might provide tailored support to sponsors, offering custom solutions for performance measurement.

### Long-Term Vision: d>cast, the First Web3 Media Network

d>sponsor is a step towards creating d>cast, the reference DAO for decentralized media. This vision encompasses all web3-oriented media activities: from publishing and community engagement to monetization and audience measurement, all managed through the $DCAST token.
