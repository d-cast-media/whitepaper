# Sponsorship Forms

### Freedom in the form of sponsorship&#x20;

The d>sponsor protocol is designed to simplify funding interactions and the acquisition of advertising rights. However, it does not impose a specific format of exposure to the audience. Instead of dictating a limited set of predefined formats, the protocol allows media companies to define the form of visibility themselves, all within a contract deployed on a blockchain.

### Control over sponsorship data displayed

While the sponsor owns the advertising space, the media retains editorial control. This means that any advertisement submitted by a sponsor must be approved by the media before it is displayed. Even if an ad is rejected, the sponsor retains ownership of the space. This mechanism aligns the interests of both parties. Thanks to the transparency of the blockchain, the entire process (submission and validation) is publicly accessible, encouraging all parties to behave positively.

### Visibility offered to sponsors: Advertising examples

The protocol's founding team suggests certain typical ad formats, while encouraging users to imagine and develop their own alternatives.

#### Clickable Logo Inserts

* _**Concept**_: A dedicated space for displaying multiple logos, with each logo inherently linked to a distinct NFT.
* _**Details**_: Upon purchasing an NFT, the sponsor has the right to provide a logo and an associated URL. Once this logo is validated, when a visitor clicks on it, they are redirected to the URL provided by the sponsor.
* _**Use**_: "Our Sponsors" sections on newsletters or websites.

#### Dynamic Banner&#x20;

* _**Concept**_: The purchase of an NFT grants the right to propose an advertising banner, which is then randomly displayed on the media platform.
* _**Details**_: Each NFT corresponds to a banner with an image and text, which can contain links. The more NFTs a sponsor owns, the greater the chance of having their banner displayed at any given time, as the system randomly selects from the validated banners.
* _**Use**_: Integration in the middle of articles, offering random visibility that is renewed with each page load.

_**Interested in Developing an Integration Module?**_\
Here are some ideas:

* _**Audio ad insertion**_: An NFT is associated with ad slots in podcast episodes (pre-roll, mid-roll, and/or post-roll). This would require integration with podcast hosting services' Dynamic Ad Insertion ([DAI](https://www.adresultsmedia.com/news-insights/dynamic-ad-insertion-for-podcasts/)) systems or development of a custom solution.
* _**Linktree link**_: Purchasing an NFT would grant the right to add a sponsored link to a linktree page. This integration could be implemented using [Linktree's API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14039622/Tzsik4P8).
* _**Highlighting within profile information:**_ By purchasing an NFT, a sponsor could gain the right to display a logo on the banner of a selected social network or add a special mention in the media's profile description on that network. This promotion would require integration with the social platform's API.

Seamless integration with existing services opens many doors for maximizing the use of the d>sponsor protocol.
