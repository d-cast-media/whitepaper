# Advertising Solutions

### Adaptability

The d>sponsor protocol is designed to simplify funding interactions and the acquisition of advertising rights. However, it doesn't limit audience exposure to a specific format. Instead of mandating a limited set of pre-defined formats, it gives media the freedom to create their own forms of visibility, all under a contract deployed on a blockchain.

### Control over advertising data displayed

While sponsors own the advertising space, media outlets maintain editorial control. This means that any ad proposed by a sponsor must be approved by the media before it is displayed. Even if an ad is rejected, the sponsor retains ownership of the space. This mechanism aligns the interests of both parties. The transparency of the blockchain ensures that the entire process, from submission to validation, is publicly accessible, encouraging positive behavior from all parties.

### Visibility opportunities for sponsors: Advertising examples

The protocol's founding team suggests certain typical ad formats, while encouraging users to imagine and develop their own alternatives.

#### Clickable Logo Inserts

* _**Concept**_: A designated space to showcase multiple logos, with each logo uniquely linked to a separate NFT.
* _**Details**_: Upon purchasing an NFT, the sponsor is entitled to provide a logo and an associated URL. Once approved, this logo will be embedded and will redirect visitors to the sponsor's URL when clicked.
* _**Use**_: "Our Sponsors" sections on newsletters or websites.

#### Dynamic Banner&#x20;

* _**Concept**_: The purchase of an NFT grants the right to propose an banner ad, which is then randomly displayed across the media platform.
* _**Details**_: Each NFT corresponds to a banner with an image and text and can contain links. The more NFTs a sponsor owns, the greater the chance of having their banner displayed at any given time, as the system randomly selects from the pool of validated banners.
* _**Use**_: Integration in the middle of articles, offering random visibility that is renewed with each page load.

_**Interested in Developing an Integration Module?**_\
Here are some ideas:

* _**Audio ad insertion**_: An NFT associated with a podcast ad slot (pre-roll, mid-roll, and/or post-roll). This would require integration with podcast hosts' Dynamic Ad Insertion ([DAI](https://www.adresultsmedia.com/news-insights/dynamic-ad-insertion-for-podcasts/)) services or the development of a custom solution.
* _**Linktree link**_: Owning an NFT would grant the right to add a sponsored link to a linktree page. This integration could be implemented through [Linktree's API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14039622/Tzsik4P8).
* _**Highlighting within profile information:**_ Purchasing an NFT grants the right to display a logo on the banner of a selected social network or add a special mention in the media's profile description on that network. This promotion would require integration with the social platform's API.

Seamless integration with existing services opens many possibilities to maximize the use of the d>sponsor protocol.
