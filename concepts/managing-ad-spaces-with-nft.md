# Managing Ad Spaces with NFT

### "Tokenizing" audience exposure

d>sponsor revolutionizes media and content creator funding by allowing sponsors to purchase advertising spaces temporarily or permanently.

The value of these ad spaces is market-driven, based on the target audience. Using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for this exposure offers significant advantages:

* **Eliminating intermediaries:** Blockchain technology facilitates direct transactions between creators and sponsors, reducing costs and complications from middlemen.
* **Ownership proof:** When a sponsor purchases an NFT for an ad space, they receive an irrefutable digital certificate granting exclusive rights to that space.
* **Easy implementation and interoperability:** The ERC721 NFT standard simplifies development, promotes collaboration and integration with other decentralized applications.
* **Financial flexibility:** Transactions can be made in various cryptocurrencies, and sponsors can resell or lease their NFT on any compatible marketplace.
* **Authenticity and traceability:** Each NFT is unique, and its usage history (origin, validity of ads) is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring total transparency and authenticity of each slot.

Integrating NFT technology into the media world enables a new era of monetization, allowing media to maintain independence while providing quality and freely accessible information.

### Interactions between Sponsor and Creator via d>sponsor

1. **Ad Offer Creation:** The creator must specify the details of ad spaces. Each token represents a unique space, and the associated NFT collection can either be pre-existing or created. If the collection is to be created, the creator must specify the number of spaces and their prices.
2. **Exposure Definition:** The creator set the validity duration and describe the audience exposure, which may include, among other things, a web banner, a clickable logo in a newsletter, or a video pre-roll. The creator also provides information about the sales clauses and the terms of use associated with the NFT that all sponsors must agree to when purchasing an NFT.&#x20;
3. **NFT Acquisition:** A sponsor interested in the offer buys an NFT, gaining ownership of the associated space.
4. **Ad Submission:** As the NFT owner, the sponsor can propose an ad for the space. For example, they can submit a logo for validation that meets the previously defined exposure criteria.
5. **Ad Validation:** The creator approves or rejects the ad. If accepted, the space is reserved for that ad (A subsequent change remains possible). If the proposal is rejected, the sponsor can submit a new one. The space will remain vacant in the meantime.

These actions are executed through smart contract transactions on a blockchain.&#x20;

#### _Validated ads integration_

The creator is responsible for integrating and displaying approved advertisements on their website (e.g., through an iframe), while fulfilling their commitments for promised exposure. A decentralized penalty mechanism will be introduced in a future version, allowing sponsors to seek compensation if they feel they did not receive the promised exposure. To calculate ROI (Return on Investment), refer to the "Performance Measurement" section.&#x20;



#### _Ad Modification_&#x20;

The sponsor can submit a new ad at any time, following the same process as steps 4 and 5.&#x20;



_**Ownership Transfer**_

The sponsor can sell the NFT on the secondary market (e.g., [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)), thus transferring ownership of the space to another sponsor.\


#### _Purchase Option_&#x20;

In a future version, the sponsor will be able to submit a conditional purchase offer based on the approval of their ad.

The use of NFTs for managing ad spaces transforms how funding operates in the media and creative sectors, providing simplicity, transparency, and financial flexibility. Sponsors can optimize their investments while providing effective support to creators.
